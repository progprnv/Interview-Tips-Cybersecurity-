## ☆ Interview Tips you should know (includes for all job domains)


Tip 1:
So what is your background? Introduce yourself.
This is the primo opportunity present yourself in the best light possible. For the love of God, please don’t summarize your resume. Instead, tell a compelling story. Tell it with some varying tone and affectation in your voice. If you don’t have a good story, come up with one. Give some genuine reflection on what led you to take this interview. They won’t remember how many years you worked at XYZ company but they will remember the warm and fuzzies from your story. Spin an emotionally striking narrative about your edgy hacker past, or your fascinating mentor, or the time you got hacked or some mildly traumatic event that lead you to your career in ethical hacking.
