# ☆ Interview Tips you should know (includes for all job domains)


### Tip 1:
So what is your background? Introduce yourself.
This is the primo opportunity present yourself in the best light possible. For the love of God, please don’t summarize your resume. Instead, tell a compelling story. Tell it with some varying tone and affectation in your voice. If you don’t have a good story, come up with one. Give some genuine reflection on what led you to take this interview. They won’t remember how many years you worked at XYZ company but they will remember the warm and fuzzies from your story. Spin an emotionally striking narrative about your edgy hacker past, or your fascinating mentor, or the time you got hacked or some mildly traumatic event that lead you to your career in ethical hacking.

### Tip 2:
General interviewing(remote) tips:

Dress in a nice dress shirt and sweat pants.
Look into your web cam, not at the faces on your screen.
Take notes during the interview or at least tell them that you are.
Don’t talk about pay until you get an offer letter.
Warm up to talking to people confidently by calling a friend before.
When they ask you vague, open-ended, scenario based technical questions, this is a gift. You can answer in any way you want. Answer in such a way to optimally showcase the skills you are most impressive in.
Answer technical questions with as much specificity and technical detail as you can possibly muster yet also balance being concise. Brevity is wit.
Be humble. Be able to say “I don’t know” gracefully. They will respect that a lot more than you trying to bullshit your way though a question. Emphasize your passion to learn.
Errors are information. Interviews are the best way to expose your weak spots. Take notes on every question and topic you are ignorant about and research later.
Be genuinely grateful that you are able to meet, be tested by and ask questions to experts in your field. This is extremely great for your professional growth irrespective if you get the job or not.



### Tip 3: (Phone call interview)

This isn’t your first remote gig - you have worked remote before, in fact you’ve had three years experience. Make sure that they understand this, you have skills that have enabled you to successfully graduate that are transferable to success in a job role and experience that shows you can be a success in working remotely.

As for a phone interview, it’s hard to gauge the interviewer when you can’t see body language and facial expression’s. Make sure you are in a quiet space, no interruptions, no doorbell or barking dogs. Make sure that you don’t have any settings on your phone that mean a call can’t come through (auto block on unknown numbers or only allowing calls from people in your contact list) because you can’t be seen you can benefit from having prompt cards - write out things like your strengths, any key info you want to communicate etc. speak clearly and leave a little gap after the question to avoid over talking. Make sure your pace isn’t too fast or rushed and that your tone is pleasant and engaged. Try to build rapport at the start and or end of the call. Ask intelligent questions they are a little different than the run of the mill. Things like asking the interviewer what they enjoy about working there, if you were to overhear people from the dept you have applied to join talking about work, what kinds of things would they be saying, how many people have gone from the job you are applying for to promotion and how long did it take and to what positions, and crucially ask how you compare to their ideal candidate - and if they say they are concerned you lack xyz be prepared to let them know that you do have that experience and tell them about it or tell them how you plan to close the gap on that.

Afterwards send an email thanking them for their time but use this as an opportunity to confer your interest in the position and reiterate your unique selling points. if you were able to get any info you could also share an article that might be of interest on something you discussed in the interview-or a book or YouTube video that they may enjoy related back to something from the interview. for example in-one interview they shared with me a problem they were trying to solve and asked me how id approach it, we got to discussing some software that would help and in my email l shared info on a vendor whose software i had used and would recommend. in others I've discovered that somebody was going on vacation to a place l had been and included a recommendation to try a specific restaurant there that was not a typical touristy type place.

thanks for your time
