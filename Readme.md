# ☆ Interview Tips you should know (includes for all job domains)


### Tip 1:
So what is your background? Introduce yourself.
This is the primo opportunity present yourself in the best light possible. For the love of God, please don’t summarize your resume. Instead, tell a compelling story. Tell it with some varying tone and affectation in your voice. If you don’t have a good story, come up with one. Give some genuine reflection on what led you to take this interview. They won’t remember how many years you worked at XYZ company but they will remember the warm and fuzzies from your story. Spin an emotionally striking narrative about your edgy hacker past, or your fascinating mentor, or the time you got hacked or some mildly traumatic event that lead you to your career in ethical hacking.

### Tip 2:
General interviewing(remote) tips:

Dress in a nice dress shirt and sweat pants.
Look into your web cam, not at the faces on your screen.
Take notes during the interview or at least tell them that you are.
Don’t talk about pay until you get an offer letter.
Warm up to talking to people confidently by calling a friend before.
When they ask you vague, open-ended, scenario based technical questions, this is a gift. You can answer in any way you want. Answer in such a way to optimally showcase the skills you are most impressive in.
Answer technical questions with as much specificity and technical detail as you can possibly muster yet also balance being concise. Brevity is wit.
Be humble. Be able to say “I don’t know” gracefully. They will respect that a lot more than you trying to bullshit your way though a question. Emphasize your passion to learn.
Errors are information. Interviews are the best way to expose your weak spots. Take notes on every question and topic you are ignorant about and research later.
Be genuinely grateful that you are able to meet, be tested by and ask questions to experts in your field. This is extremely great for your professional growth irrespective if you get the job or not.
